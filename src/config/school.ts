// src/config/school.ts

// This file is now used for general school-related configurations,
// but not for a single hardcoded school ID.
// Any configurations that might be shared across schools can go here.

// For example:
export const DEFAULT_CURRENCY = 'UGX';

// The SINGLE_SCHOOL_ID constant has been removed to support a multi-school architecture.
// The application will now derive the school ID from the URL or user session.
